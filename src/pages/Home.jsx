        Discover a world where technology meets creativity! I'm Cody, a developer with a flair for crafting innovative solutions that simplify and enhance lives. From the fundamentals of JavaScript, React, and HTML/CSS to the complexities of MongoDB, MySQL, and Node.js, my portfolio showcases a diverse range of projects. Each piece is a testament to my journey from a sales professional to a tech enthusiast who believes in the power of coding to change the world. Of course, my journey for knowledge is never over, I hope to learn as much as I can along the way and am looking to find a company who can see what I can offer!

        Dive into my work and see how my passion for tech, combined with a background in sales, shapes applications that are not just technically sound but also user-centric and market-ready. Whether it's web development, database management, or creating interactive user experiences, my portfolio is a window into my professional evolution and a reflection of my commitment to continuous learning and improvement.

        Enjoy exploring my creations!
